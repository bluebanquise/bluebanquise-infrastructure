<h1>The project</h1>

<h2>The need</h2>

While building a small HPC center in the FabLab <a href="https://www.lafabriqueduloch.org">La Fabrique du Loch</a>, at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auray">Auray</a> – France, we needed something simple, to manage our cluster and our workstations, but also very flexible as we are working with enterprises and universities (some wants Centos, others Ubuntu, etc).<br>
<br>
We also wanted something with less scripts as possible, to easily maintain the product and spend less time managing the cluster to save spare time doing interesting things.<br>
<br>
This is how Banquise and then <span style="color: #108bde">Blue</span>Banquise were born.

<h2>What it can do</h2>

<span style="color: #108bde">Blue</span>Banquise is a generic stack, made to handle simple workstations IT room, HPC cluster, enterprise network, etc. We try to keep it as simple as possible, having advanced features optional and hidden.

<h3>Supported OS and platform</h3>

In its current state, stack can deploy on mixed Linux distributions and platform at the same time, including:

<ul>
  <li>Centos/RHEL 7.6 and 8.0, with all features</li>
  <li>Ubuntu 18.04 with limited features</li>
  <li>OpenSuse Leap 15.1 with very limited features (PXE able only)</li>
</ul>
Depending of the demand, Ubuntu or OpenSuse can be fully implemented.
<br>
Tested platform were <b>x86_64</b> for Centos/RHEL/OpenSuse Leap and <b>arm64/x86_64</b> for Ubuntu.<br>
<br>
This ability to handle multiple Linux distributions at the same time allows to easily handle exotic hardware or customer needs.

<h3>Stack data</h3>

All stack data are stored in plain text files, in YAML format, using Ansible inventory folders structure. No binaries + no databases = fully editable and tunable with minimal knowledge.

<h3>Roles</h3>

The stack is fully modular, and provides natives core and addons Ansible roles. Roles are nearly all independent from each other's, to be easily replaced by custom ones.

<h4>Core</h4>

<ul>
  <li> /etc/hosts file</li>
  <li> DHCP (server) with optional advanced features</li>
  <li> DNS (server/client)</li>
  <li> Time synchronisation (serber/client)</li>
  <li> Full advanced PXE stack, based on verbosity and flexibility</li>
  <ul>
    <li> Tftp based on atftp (with verbosity on by default)</li>
    <li> Http based on Apache for all repositories and images</li>
    <li> iPXE custom ROMs with menu, to handle all exotic hardware</li>
    <ul>
      <li> EFI / Legacy</li>
      <li> PXE / iPXE native ROM</li>
      <li> CD or USB boot to PXE when no native PXE available (or stupidly made BIOS/EFI)</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li> Repositories (server/client)</li>
  <li> NIC configuration (based on files or using Ansible NMCLI module)</li>
  <li> Rsyslog (server/client)</li>
  <li> Conman (active server)</li>
  <li> NFS (server/client)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Addons</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Slurm (basic configuration, master/nodes)</li>
  <li> Clustershell groups based on Ansible groups</li>
  <li> Basic OpenLdap (server/client) with phpldapadmin (currently unsecure)</li>
  <li> Very basic user’s management for very small clusters with a single login node to replace Ldap</li>
  <li> Prometheus configuration (Prometheus, Alertmanager, NodeExporter, with basic configuration and already few alerts)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Modularity</h3>

<span style="color: #108bde">Blue</span>Banquise has been design to be as modular as possible. As a consequence, data in inventory can be manipulated as desired, and all Ansible roles are tunable or replaceable. See <span style="color: #108bde">Blue</span>Banquise more like a skeleton, ready to handle flesh.

<h3>Specific advanced features</h3>

The stack also as few native mechanisms under the hood. These features are a need for us, so we added them.

<h4>Multi Icebergs</h4>

This feature is sometime called multi islands in HPC or Cloud.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #108bde">Blue</span>Banquise can split cluster into independent and autonomous groups of equipment. These new subclusters are called <b>icebergs</b>, each iceberg being managed by a group of management nodes and isolated from the others (but can be reached through interconnect if exist and asked).<br>
<br>
This feature is mainly used:

<ul>
  <li>When there is a need to separated parts of the cluster (our case, to provide dedicated small sub-clusters to some customers).</li>
  <li>When there is a need to run an old cluster aside a new one keeping both in production.</li>
  <li>When there is a need to scale to very large number of hosts.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Accelerated mode</h4>

Ansible is famous for its simplicity, but also for being slow, even with Mitogen.<br>
<br>
Accelerated mode is a POC we designed to heavily accelerate critical templates rendering. It is based on some retro engineering we made on Ansible. It also reduces memory usage.<br>
<br>
Accelerated mode is just a basic trick we found in the inventory, that requires no Ansible modifications.<br>
<br>
Note that this feature is only at POC state for the time being, as it needs extended developments in roles templates. We are waiting for the stack being more "mature" to fully implement it.
